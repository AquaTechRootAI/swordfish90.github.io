Hello again my friends, in this very hot day I want to share with you something cool!
It's a cool-retro-term fork specifically designed for music live coding.

It combines many of the graphical effects of CRT with a supercollider based music visualization.
You can basically run any cli application commanding a supercollider backend and see music.

crt-live-coding is using FoxDot (which is amazing) and vim as a text editor.

Since a picture is worth a thousand words, and a video is literally worth a thousand pictures here's me playing with it:

This is still a very early release, but if you want to try it out you can find the source code on github:

Enjoy!
