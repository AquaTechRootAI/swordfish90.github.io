Santa was a little bit late this year; check again under your tree, there might be another surprise waiting for you: v1.0.0-RC1 of Cool-Retro-Term. What's inside? Well, in the last few weeks I've been working very hard to polish the experience, fix issues and improve performances. In a bulleted list:


* CRT is now snappier and lighter on resources (the performance settings are also much more useful)
* Profiles import/export (json files)
* More fonts
* The OS X version has feature parity with the Linux one (there is also a DMG file on the github release page)
* Plenty of fixes.

I wanted to thank all the people who donated, contributed or helped with the packaging. Youâ€™ve all been awesome!

Enjoy CRT and please share if you create an awesome profile or frame. I might include it in the final version!
