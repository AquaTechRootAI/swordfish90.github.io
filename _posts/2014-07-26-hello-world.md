Well here we are... I always felt the need to find a place to share some thoughts, so I'm starting my shiny new blog.

I'm Filippo Scognamiglio and I'm currently a Computer Engineering student at "Universit√† di Pavia", so you should expect basically nerdy stuff on this page (although I reserve the right to rant about anything).

I dislike long introductions so stay tuned for some real content...
