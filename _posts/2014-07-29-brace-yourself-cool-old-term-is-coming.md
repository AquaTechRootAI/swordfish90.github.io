Since when I played Fallout III for the first time I have always wanted my terminal to look like those old jittery CRT screens that you loved in the game. Sadly there was nothing like that on Linux... Till I decided to make one myself!

In the last six months I dedicated some of my spare time to create a terminal emulator which had to look that way, but also had to be customizable and reasonably lightweight. Now the project is near completion I want to share with everyone the result!
