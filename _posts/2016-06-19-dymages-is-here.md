More than a year has gone since I updated this blog, but that doesnâ€™t mean youâ€™ve been abandoned ðŸ™‚. Today Iâ€™m finally very happy to present my latest pet project: Dymages.

Itâ€™s an Android application which animates your still pictures with with beautiful weather, color and artistic effects. You can also share your creations with the rest of the world or just behold at the beauties others created for you.

In this case a video is probably worth a thousand words. Enjoy!
