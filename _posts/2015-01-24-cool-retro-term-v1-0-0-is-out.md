The v1.0.0 of CRT is finally among us. The 43 commits landed after RC1 brought big performance improvements and fixes.

* Improved font upscaling with much better performances
* Huge improvements in quality and speed of burn-in effect (especially at low FPSs)
* Optimisations in bloom effect
* New fonts
* [Linux] Fix bad behaviours in colour dialog
* [OSX] Fix UTF8 characters issues
* [OSX] Fix ALT key behaviour
* Many other small fixes/improvements/cleanups

Thanks to some great guys CRT is already packaged for many Linux distributions; you can follow the procedure at [https://github.com/Swordfish90/cool-retro-term](https://github.com/Swordfish90/cool-retro-term) to download and install it.

Huge thanks to the community folks who helped shape this program with their patches, donations, comments and ideas. I just canâ€™t describe how awesome you have been.

Enjoy CRT!
