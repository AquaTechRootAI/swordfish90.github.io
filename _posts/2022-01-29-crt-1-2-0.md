These last few months have been particularly busy for me, both from a personal and professional perspective. My open-source time was reduced to basically zero, but I feel like I'm slowly getting back on track.

I decided to revisit an old friend, which was desperately in need for some love, so I'm very proud to announce version **1.2.0** of **cool-retro-term**.

Here you can find the changelog:

* Migrated QtQuickControls from 1.x to 2.x
* Fixed a lot of issues with MacOS build
* Added support for blinking cursor
* Added sub-pixels rasterization
* Updated qtermwidget engine
* Updated many fonts to the latest version

As always, you can grab it from the [GitHub Release page](https://github.com/Swordfish90/cool-retro-term/releases/tag/1.2.0).

Cheers!
