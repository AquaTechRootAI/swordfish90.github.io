The first stable version of Lemuroid was released [about a month ago](https://swordfish90.github.io/welcome-lemuroid.html), but I'm not done with it just yet. You guys have been amazing and provided a lot of feedback, which was distilled into version 1.1.1, released just a few days ago.

For starters we have a few new systems:

* Sony PlayStation (PSX) (with multidisk support in .pbp format)
* Atari 2600 (A26)
* Sega Game Gear (GG)


Then we have some new features:
* Labels on buttons (this was probably the most wanted feature :D)
* Improved detection for iso/pbp files
* Virtual buttons no longer overlap with touchscreen on NDS
* Added a virtual button which simulates microphone noise on NDS


And to finish, I also exposed a few core options such as:
* Game Boy colorization palette and LCD blur
* Video filters and color correction for various systems
* Frameskip for PSX and NDS


As always, you can find the source code on [Github](https://github.com/Swordfish90/Lemuroid) or grab it from [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.swordfish.lemuroid).

Enjoy!
