Hi fellow readers,

in the last few months I’ve been working very hard to give CRT some of the love it deserves, and I’m very proud to announce you this new major release!

The most important changes include:

* Two years of upstream (qtermwidget) terminal fixes
* Big performance improvements (and lowered resource consumption)
* New shiny (literally) frame
* System fonts support
* Countless under-the-hood improvements and fixes

On the packaging side (many thank to [https://github.com/probonopd](https://github.com/probonopd)) we also have CRT AppImages, which are easy to install on any Linux distribution; Ubuntu users will have to wait a bit more, but a proper snap package is on the way (thanks to [https://github.com/kz6fittycent](https://github.com/kz6fittycent)).

You can grab the latest AppImage and dmg files from here:

Have fun!
