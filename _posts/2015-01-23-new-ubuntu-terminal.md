Just a short announcement today: the new reboot version of Ubuntu Terminal App has finally landed as default!

For those who havenâ€™t tried the development version, the most notable differences for end users are:

* Redesigned look to maximize screen estate and improve touch interaction
* Configurable keyboard bar which allows custom keys or commands (in the future via JSON files)
* Keyboard selector to change on the fly keyboard bar layout
* Tabs support with live preview
* Copy, paste and selection
* Overall improvements in stability

The update should come automatically if you have the old version installed. Feel free to contact us if you have any bug or suggestion.

PS: Huge thanks to Alan Pope for its coaching and for the screenshots (he is the Master of Screenshots).
