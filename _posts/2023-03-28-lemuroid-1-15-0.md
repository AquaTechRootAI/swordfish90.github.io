Dear fellow readers,

It has been a long time since I last wrote here, but I'm back with some exciting news.

**Lemuroid 1.15.0** is out and comes with major improvements to the **HD mode**.

I've spent the last few months working on a new upscaling algorithm, called unsurprisingly **CUT2**, which improves interpolation and handles edges at 30°, 45° and 60° degrees.

Feel free to check more screenshots and details on the [CUT Github page](https://github.com/Swordfish90/cheap-upscaling-triangulation).

If you prefer, you can still use the older version by toggling "Advanced Settings -> Prefer Legacy HD Mode".

As always, you can grab the latest Lemuroid version, with updated cores and database, on [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.swordfish.lemuroid), [Github](https://github.com/Swordfish90/Lemuroid/releases/tag/1.15.0) and [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.swordfish.lemuroid/).

Cheers!
