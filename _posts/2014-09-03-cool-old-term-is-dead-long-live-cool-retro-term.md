What?!... No, don't be alarmed; cool-old-term has just changed name in cool-retro-term.

But why?... Well, cool-old-term was a sort of boilerplate name I chose at the beginning of the project and it stuck when the project became more popular. cool-retro-term keeps familiarity and has a very cool acronym so we can talk nerdy: "Have you tried CRT. It's really great!".

Why didn't you do that before?... Because I was planning to change the way the program is built and I didn't want to break the packages twice. Now all packages can be updated only once and I promise I won't break them again anytime soon.

What else did you change?... Well in the last month many things have. New features such as mouse support, color support, improved/fixed key combinations have landed in master together with many bugfixes. Moreover we are working on a OSX port which will see major improvements in the short future.

Why are you interviewing yourself?... I actually don't know, but I'm going to take advantage of this question to thank all the people who contributed to the project. Some of you helped with the code, some with the packaging/docs, some donated money and some just spread the world.

You have all been amazing! Thank you very much!
